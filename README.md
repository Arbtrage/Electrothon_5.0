Forgetting to take medication or missing doses can have serious consequences, especially for people with chronic illnesses or those taking multiple medications. It can lead to worsened health conditions, hospitalizations, and even death in extreme cases. Many people also struggle to keep track of their medical history, making it difficult for healthcare providers to provide effective treatment.

Our application solves these problems by sending timely notifications to remind users to take their medication and providing an option to notify family members in case of missed doses. This helps ensure that users take their medication on time and consistently, leading to better health outcomes. The monthly reports of user's medical history generated by our application also help users keep track of their health and provide important information for healthcare providers. Overall, our application helps improve medication adherence and better manage chronic illnesses.
