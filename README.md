# You Will Know It Soon (YWKIT)

Our project is a web application that helps users manage their medication schedule and keep track of their family member's medication schedules as well. The application sends timely notifications to remind users to take their medicine and provides an option to notify family members in case of missed doses. The notifications are sent through WhatsApp and calls are made in case of no response from the user. The application also generates monthly reports for the user's medication history. Additionally, a chatbot is integrated to assist users in managing their medication and answering related queries.
